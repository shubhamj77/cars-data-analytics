Cars Data Analysis
This project analyzes car specifications and characteristics using Python and pandas. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, filtering, and transformation operations on car dataset.

Features
Loads and inspects the car dataset
Handles missing values (fills null values with mean)
Explores different car makes and their counts
Filters records by origin (Asia/Europe) and weight criteria
Transforms data by applying functions to columns
Performs statistical analysis and data manipulation

How to Run
Open the notebook notebooks/cars_data.ipynb in VS Code or Jupyter.
Run cells sequentially to execute all analysis steps.
Make sure the dataset is present at datasets/dataset.csv.

Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
The dataset should be placed in the datasets folder as dataset.csv. It contains car records with columns like Make, Origin, Cylinders, Weight, MPG_City, and other car specifications.
